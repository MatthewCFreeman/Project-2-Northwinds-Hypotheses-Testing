# Project-2-Northwinds-Hypotheses-Testing

Formal project to gather sales data from a popular SQL database and test hypotheses.


**Project-2-Northwinds-Hpothesis-Testing.ipynb** is the notebook where the data was scrubbed, analysed, and tested.

**Project-2-Executive-Summary.ppt** is the presentation summarising the analysis and conclusions.

**Northwind_small.sqlite** is the copy of the SQL database being used.

**Northwind_ERD.png** is the image displayed at the beginning of the Jupyter notebook showing the schema of the database.

**README.md** is this document you are currently viewing, explaining the layout of this repository.
